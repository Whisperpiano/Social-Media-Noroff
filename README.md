# CSS Frameworks Project - Noroff

This repository is for the **CSS Frameworks** course project at Noroff. The original task was to take an application built with vanilla JavaScript and style it using **Tailwind CSS**.

However, I decided to build the project from scratch to practice **React**, **TypeScript**, and **React Router**, creating the design entirely from the ground up.
